                Next Gen STEM is a completely free resource for 
                students to learn the basics of coding! Our organization
                was built off of the fact that students across the 
                country and world do not have the proper resources to
                learn how to code despite its overwhelming prevalence
                across job fields today.
            </p>
            <p class="coding-info">
                In a study performed by Google, 9 out of 10 parents believed 
                that Computer Science education would be a good use of resources 
                at schools and over 60% of superintendents and principals agree 
                that computer science courses should be valued the same as 
                common courses including math, science, history, and English. 
                Yet, about 40% of 9,774 principles surveyed said that
                their schools offer 0 computer science courses at their school.
            </p>
            <p class="coding-info">
                Next Gen STEM is constantly working to provide students with more 
                and more resources and ways to learn how to code. Whether through
                courses that are taught through live instruction, video lessons,
                written lessons, or a mix of all of the above, students will
                be provided with the STEM education that works best for them at
                no cost.
