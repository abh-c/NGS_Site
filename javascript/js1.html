        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <p>
            JavaScript (JS) is an incredibly widespread and popular
            programming language that is present in most of the
            websites you have ever visited. JS allows for greater
            interactivity with the user of a website, including things
            we take for granted in websites today, like playing audio,
            playing video, animating certain elements, and even drop-down
            menus! The language is easy to get started with and is
            used in both front and back-end development professionally.

            To develop code more easily, most developers use a program 
            called an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which 
            has many useful features, like a debugger and syntax highlighting. 
            An IDE is not necessary for learning the basics of JS, but it is 
            very convenient. This course will make use of the 
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">Visual Studio 
            Code</a>, text editor because it is free and versatile. If you like, 
            you could use any other editor or IDE suitable for developing JavaScript, 
            like Atom or Sublime Text. For the purposes of learning, you could 
            even use an online tool, like <a href="https://jsfiddle.net" target="_blank">
            https://jsfiddle.net</a>, to run simple 
            JS code. Search something like “run js online” for more options. 
            You could even write code in a simple text document, if you wanted to.
